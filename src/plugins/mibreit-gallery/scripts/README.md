# fastAverageColor installation

To display the sqrt color as background for fullscreen display of the galleries, you have to download the fastAverageColor script by Denis Seleznev. 

You can get the minified version from here -> https://unpkg.com/fast-average-color/dist/index.min.js

Copy and paste the content of this file into the fastAverageColor.js file within this folder. Then run gulp again to build with color averaging.
