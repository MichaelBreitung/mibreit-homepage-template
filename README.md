# mibreit-photo Homepage Template

## About

Homepage Template based on Gulp and Nunjucks, which makes it easy to create html/php that also include a Wordpress blog.

## Install

1. clone, fork or download the repository 
2. call npm install in the root folder
3. download minified jQuery Version -> see src/scripts/base/jquery/README.md
4. download minified jQuery.validate Version -> see src/scripts/base/jquery/README.md
5. make changes to page-data.json,  custom variant and pages
5. run gulp

Important: You should not touch the base variant, since this is where I make regular updates and where I add features that you can reuse in the custom variant or in your own variants.

Note: You can create additional variants, other than custom. Just create another variant folder and add a config.json. If you want to build a specific variant, you can run _gulp --variant [folder of the variant]_. 

## Technology

## Collaborate

Although I'm a software developer and a quick learner, there are certainly things that can be improved with this template. So if you have suggestions, feel free to [contact me](https://www.mibreit-photo.com/contact.html?subject=Homepage%20Template%20Github) - maybe we can collaborate to improve the template. One topic where I would really need some feedback, for example, is SEO. I'm sure there are some tweaks I can make to further improve the template.
